Factoring of co-prime numbers using a classical computer

Let B : Prime Factorization Equation of form (x * y) - c = 1

& M : (x * y) - c

where; c = number to be factored(d) - 1.



Let B_1 : Diophatine Equation of form (a^n + b^n + .... + z^n) - c = 1

& M_1 : (a^n_1 + b^n_2 + .... + z^n) - c

where; c = value of the diophatine equation(v) - 1.



Let Kareem Expression (K.E(K)) = (K + 1)/((F * (K - 1)) + 1)

where; F is a very positive large number that approaches infinity.



S_1 : Sum[K.E(M),{x,-d,d},{y,-d,d}]

S_1/2 is exactly the number of possible integer combinations of (x * y) that is equal to (c + 1)



S_2 : Sum[K.E(M_1),{a,-v,v},{b,-v,v},...,{z,-v,v}]

S2/2 is exactly the number of possible integer combinations of (a^n_1 + b^n_2 + .... + z^n) that is equal to (c + 1)
